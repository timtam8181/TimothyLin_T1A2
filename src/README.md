## Purpose 
The purpose of this website is for me to demostrate the skills that I have learnt, and how I implement them into developing a website. To also showcase some of my skills and experiences in life to prospective employers.

## Functionality / features 
This website takes advantage of flexbox, to provide the ability to create a layout that is compatible for viewing on different devices. There is also a navigation bar to ease the process of browsing the website and switching between pages. There are links to my socials, and my resume.
